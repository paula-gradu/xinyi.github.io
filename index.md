## Xinyi Chen

I'm a research engineer at [Google AI](https://ai.google/research/). I'm interested in algorithms in machine learning, specifically online learning and nonconvex optimization. I graduated from the math department at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/).
