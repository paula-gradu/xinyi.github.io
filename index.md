## Xinyi Chen

I'm a research engineer at [Google Brain](https://ai.google/research/). I work on algorithms in machine learning, specifically online learning and nonconvex optimization. During my undergraduate studies at [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/), I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/).
